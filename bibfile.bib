abstract = {Summary
Participation in the Bitcoin blockchain validation process requires specialized hardware and vast amounts of electricity, which translates into a significant carbon footprint. Here, we demonstrate a methodology for estimating the power consumption associated with Bitcoin’s blockchain based on IPO filings of major hardware manufacturers, insights on mining facility operations, and mining pool compositions. We then translate our power consumption estimate into carbon emissions, using the localization of IP addresses. We determine the annual electricity consumption of Bitcoin, as of November 2018, to be 45.8 TWh and estimate that annual carbon emissions range from 22.0 to 22.9 MtCO2. This means that the emissions produced by Bitcoin sit between the levels produced by the nations of Jordan and Sri Lanka, which is comparable to the level of Kansas City. With this article, we aim to gauge the external costs of Bitcoin and inform the broader debate on the costs and benefits of cryptocurrencies.}

                  Technology is continuously increasing and offering solutions
                  to various application areas. In the last few decades, much
                  more developments in various features are seen to improve the
                  performance, but still scalability is becoming the bottleneck
                  for the performance enhancement. The scalability problem
                  further leads to severe delays and high costs in a bitcoin
                  network. Nowadays, the real-time transactions in
                  cryptocurrencies need to be scaled up from seven transactions
                  per second to thousands of transactions per second to handle
                  real-life problems in the field of visa, healthcare, flights,
                  etc. In this paper, a detailed study on the scalability
                  issues, Proof of Work, and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant
                  in blockchain was given. It also explored and analyzed the
                  recent promising research areas in blockchain scalability such
                  as net neutrality, sharding, side-chain, and off-chain scaling

                  peer-to-peer overlay network to support substantially higher

                  next-generation, high-load blockchain protocols, and major
                  advances will additionally require a basic rethinking of
                  technical approaches. We offer a structured perspective on the
