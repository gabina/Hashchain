Validator keys
Protecting a validator's consensus key is the most important factor to take in when designing your setup. The key that a validator is 
given upon creation of the node is called a consensus key, it has to be online at all times in order to vote on blocks. It is not 
recommended to merely hold your private key in the default json file (priv_validator_key.json). Fortunately, the Interchain Foundation 
(opens new window)has worked with a team to build a key management server for validators. You can find documentation on how to use it 
here (opens new window), it is used extensively in production. You are not limited to using this tool, there are also HSMs (opens new 
window), there is not a recommended HSM.

Currently Tendermint uses Ed25519 (opens new window)keys which are widely supported across the security sector and HSMs.
